# AWS-Risk-Labs

These labs have been developed specifically with risk, compliance and controls assurance stakeholders in mind. AWS provides a wealth of services and tools to assist in effective management and governance and provides a level of transparency and automation not possible in a traditional environment. These labs aim to demonstrate how these services and the telemetry available on the platform can be used to automate controls assurance and provide a real time risk data. 

These labs have been designed to cater for the absolute beginner, building up to more advanced topics.

This repository contains the code which supports the hands-on labs at [Risk Lab Git Repo](https://pauljrcurtis.github.io/risk-lab-site/)

Some code, particularly that which supports the introductory labs maybe be simplified to demonstrate concepts rather than attempting to be production ready approaches.
